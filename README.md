# One Line A Day

## Description
The One Line a Day platform provides an insightful snapshot of your thoughts, memories, change, and progress on each of the 365 days of the year. Gives users a single location to record ðŸ“– and retrieve their thoughts ðŸ’­.

Users can log in and start making entries in their journal. They can create, review, update, and delete data. The app functions as a journal and you can see all entries each day.
